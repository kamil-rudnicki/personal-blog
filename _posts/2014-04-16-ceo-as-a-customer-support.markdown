<blockquote>"btw, its nice to talk to you directly on chat, its a rare case to have CEO on line :) "</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what our client said to me on <a href="http://www.livechatinc.com">Livechat</a> when I was talking with him about new report that he would like to have in <a title="time tracking timecamp" href="http://www.timecamp.com">TimeCamp</a>.</p>
<p>I recently find out about <a href="http://www.ceoonsupport.com/">http://www.ceoonsupport.com/</a> idea. I was doing this for a long time, and I'm very happy that this gets it's light in movement started by <a href="http://freshdesk.com/">Freshdesk</a>. I can't tell you how much benefits it has! For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I learn about customers</li>
<li>I know what pain points they have</li>
<li>I can ask them question and have meanignful conversation</li>
<li>I know what features they like</li>
<li>I know what features they would like to have</li>
<li>I know the issues in TimeCamp</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that this can take time, but looking at my report from TimeCamp I spent in the last 30 days 5 hours on livechat and 5 hours on support tickets. But hell, I learned so much. I think this is my best and most efficient touch point with clients. It's eye opening.</p>
<p>I can get strategic point of view at problems from our customers, but talking with them directly gives me more meaning.</p>
