<ul>
<li>Building too complex analytics (metrics was not practical)</li>
<li>Creating second niche product, based on my main product (I should have known what I am building, have a strategy, and implement it with the main brand)</li>
<li>Accepting features requests that only one company will be using</li>
<li>Allowing low quality and buggy code</li>
<li>Didn&#8217;t used unit testing from the start</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="inline_editor_value"><strong>Marketings &amp; Sales</strong><br /></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Waste time on business partners before product-market fit</li>
<li>Building integrations with other software that nobody wanted</li>
<li>Wasn&#8217;t doing SEO from day one</li>
<li>Weren&#8217;t contacting customers at least three times per week</li>
</ul>
