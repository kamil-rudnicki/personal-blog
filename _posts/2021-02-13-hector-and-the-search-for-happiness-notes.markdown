Movie "Hector and the Search for Happiness" is based on a novel by a French psychiatrist and author. I really enjoyed watching it on Netflix, as it's not only for entertainment.

Here are some quotes from the movie:

> Making comparisons can spoil your happiness.
> A lot of people think happiness is being rich or important.
> Many people see happiness only in their future.
> Happiness could be the freedom to love more than one woman at the same time.
> Sometimes happiness is not knowing the whole story.
> Avoiding unhappiness is not the road to happiness.
> Does the person you're with bring you predominately A): Up or B): Down?
> Happiness is answering your calling.
> Happiness is being loved for who you are.
> Fear is an impediment to happiness.
> Happiness is feeling completely alive.
> Happiness is knowing how to celebrate.
> Listening is loving.
> Nostalgia is not what it used to be.

**Additional quotes**

> I am not happy because my wife is not. She's not, then the kids aren't either.
> Fear is an obstacle to happiness
> He who fears death fears living the life
> As it comes to marriage, I never regretted it, and that is happiness.
> Happiness is using all your three basic emotions at the same time.
