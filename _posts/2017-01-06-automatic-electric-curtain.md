You need:
- About 3 hours of free time
- Universal AC/DC power 12V 2000mA ($12)
- Electric motor Modelcraft RB-35 1:100 ($20)
- Hobby 36155 Terra Timer pro (timer with seconds) ($18)
- Electric wire ($1)
- Wooden spool 6mm ($1)
- Tape ($1)
- String ($1)

Total: $54

Step by step instructions:
- Mount the wooden spool into the electric motor using three screws
- Put additional screw at the middle of the spool to hook the string
- Put tape on the screws
- Mount the electric motor to something (in my case I had a heating pipe)
- Cut string with appropriate lentgth and assign it to spool and courtin
- Program your timer to run for 20 seconds (less or more) at 5 am to automatically open the courtain each weekday

Problems yet to solve:
- How to make automtic string unbinding (now I do this manually)
- How to prevent electric motor to run when courtain is shadowed
