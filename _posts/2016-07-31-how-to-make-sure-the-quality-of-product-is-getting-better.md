Imagine that you put a lot of effort in making your software better. But there is a metric that is showing otherwise. You are starting to wonder what the heck. How it would be possible, that we invested so much, to make the product better, and still, it is getting worse. Does it mean that doing nothing was a better option. That would be funny, you think.

So long story short, after simple A/B test with old and current version of the software, you clearly see that current version is doing so much better then old.
