<div>
<ol>
<li><span>First thing first, you should gather all the informations you already have received in one place.</span></li>
<li><span>Gather names of all the customers you already have and you want to learn about.</span></li>
<li><span>Try to learn about every one of them from your internal usage analytics and make notes.</span></li>
<li><span>Choose about 10 customers to call - first three customers should be not the most important ones.</span></li>
<li>Define list of features you want to learn about.</li>
<li>Design solutions, by your own intuition.</li>
<li>Brainstorm 2-3 questions - make them concrete, but always ask why.</li>
<li>Brainstorm more questions about concrete ideas about features.</li>
<li>Call and make notes.</li>
</ol>
<div>Example questions?</div>
