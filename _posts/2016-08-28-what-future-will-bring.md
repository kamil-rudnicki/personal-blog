In elementary school there should be lessons for developing character ( uk is starting this)

There should be central graph database with knowledge browsed by usefulness or topic. So people will be better thinkers and problem solvers

There will be no poor people. And by poor I mean basic housing food and clothing and access to knowledge 

100% renowable and clean energy 

Eliminate destructive tv shows mass media that is making human more stupid 

There should be places to be in nature. No the. Not commercial

People will be more friendly and less anonymous to each other

There will be no house work as robots and machines  will help us and they will be very affordable 

People will be more self aware, more rationale, more contemporary, better decision makers

I can't wait for this future to come :)
