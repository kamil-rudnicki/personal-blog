<p>I recently saw two beautiful presentations, in which content was inspired by Steve Jobs. They are not exactly about how to do small things in a company. They go further. Those presentations are on strategic thinking which I believe are good for entrepreneurs - I strongly believe that they are true.</p>
<p>So I am happy to introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR_wX0EwOMM&amp;feature=related">12 Lessons Steve Jobs Tought - Guy Kawaskai</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.siliconvalleyhistorical.org/home/steve_jobs_secrets_of_life">Steve Jobs: Secrets of life</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the lessons learned from those presentations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore experts.</li>
<li>The life that I live is made by people that are no smarter than I. Question it. Build things.</li>
<li>Take action, ship. You must be brave to this this.</li>
<li>Customers can&#8217;t tell you what they need. They will only suggest you cheaper, 10% better, quicker solutions.</li>
</ul>
