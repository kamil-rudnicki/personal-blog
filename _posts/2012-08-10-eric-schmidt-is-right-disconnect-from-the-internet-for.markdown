<p>Watching Eric Schmidt Keynote on UC Berkley I was wondering if Eric Schmidt is right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disconnect from Internet for an one hour a day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you know what, he is 100% right in this case. Why?</p>
<p>Do you have experience from of the old times (when the Internet didn&#8217;t exist yet), when you were bored, you have nothing to do - you dreamed, you thought, you get peace of mind and energy? I feel right now that way. I deleted all the blogs I should read, all the podcast to watch, and read it later pages. The week before I also deleted my Facebook account. Now I have nothing to do, and I feel peace of mind, I feel like changing the world!</p>
<p>People need to feel sometimes that there is nothing to do anymore. Global connection, thanks to devices you have in your pocket, on your lap is an enemy here. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m not against them. Just hoping you will understand, that the Internet is causing we feel, that there is always something to watch, to learn, to read, <strong>external</strong> bad things&#8230;.</p>
<p>I throw them away, and make a room to think. Do you agree with me?</p>
