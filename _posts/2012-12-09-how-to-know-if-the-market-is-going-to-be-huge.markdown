<p>How to know if the market is going to be huge?</p>
<p>Maybe you should look for competitors. Do they grow (like crazy)?</p>
<p>If you will be asking yourself, should I start Google, think how your competitors are growing? They probably had been growing, and you was able to see it. Checked - Google.</p>
<p>If you will be asking yourself, should I start making PC, think how your competitors are doing. There had been growing interest in computers, and you was able to see it. Checked - Apple, Microsoft, Linux.</p>
<p>If you will be asking yourself, should I start another payment gateway? Think how your competitors are growing? Maybe not. But they are huge already. But they also are broken. Checked - Stripe, and other startups that works in another countries. </p>
<p>YouTube - video websites,<br />Liveperson - Livechat, <br />Badoo - social netowrking, <br />Square - smart phones, <br />Webex - GoToMetting, <br />Gmail - Outlook,</p>
<p>Now I am thinking about commons:</p>
<ul>
<li>competitor that sucks, and even then they are pretty successful (niche)</li>
<li>or clearly seeing growing interest on a subject (making a growing market)</li>
<li>or &#8230; (will be continue)</li>
</ul>
<p>How to win with competitors - that another story&#8230;</p>
