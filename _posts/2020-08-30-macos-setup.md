I'm spending over 9 hours per day in front of the computer. So gain in productivity in the environment I work with have clear benefits. Here are my top hacks.

**Apps**

* I use Roam Research for [knowledge management](https://roamresearch.com). I added Roam Research website (https://roamresearch.com/#/app/xxx) as desktop application using Multi [https://github.com/kofigumbs/multi](https://github.com/kofigumbs/multi). Multi is better than other apps, because it uses Safari engine instead of Google Chrome engine which is better for battery and memory.

**Desk**

I use Herman [Miller Mirra 2](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_eur/products/seating/office-chairs/mirra-2-chairs/) chair, which I bought on eBay for half of the price. It was great upgrade from my pervious Ikea chair. I also got second monitor and standing desk. The desk area is also bigger so I have more space for my legs. Thanks to this I'm able to work in front of the desk longer than before.

**System preferences**

* In Terminal: `defaults write com.apple.screencapture show-thumbnail -bool FALSE` - disable the floating screenshots preview on Mac, which delays saving screenshot on disk for a couple of seconds

Other
* Open cards in tabs setting
* Three finger drag setting
* Automation to open any file with Visual Studio Code
* Automation to upload any file to Dropbox and get the link in clipboard
* Automation to make password protected zip from selection
* Save screenshots in Downloads
* Finder opens Downloads folder by default
* Finder sort by date created and view in listf
* Integrate calendar and use Macos native calendar and email
* Use aText for automatic text expansions, saves thousands of keystrokes
* Use clipboard history Flycut
* Learn keyboard shortcuts for most often used apps like Safari, Notes, System
