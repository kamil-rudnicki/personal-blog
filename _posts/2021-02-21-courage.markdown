> I got up and addressed the cast and crew. “We tried something big and it didn’t work,” I said. “I’d much rather take big risks and sometimes fail than not take risks at all.

> Too often, we lead from a place of fear rather than courage, stubbornly trying to build a bulwark to protect old models that can’t possibly survive the sea change that is under way. It’s hard to look at your current models, sometimes even ones that are profitable in the moment, and make a decision to undermine them in order to face the change that’s coming.

Courage is a virtue that is universal for me and you and everyone in this and future generations.

You can use it almost every day. So think about it and actively work to be better at it.

## What is courage?

You can apply courage for decision-making and to act. If you don't have the courage to follow a path that looks scary to you (but in the end, it has a better outcome), then it's a failure of your courage.

## How to apply it in practice?

There is courage applied passively and actively.

### Passive way

When the moment comes to you, you take courageous action. Moment by moment. Day by day. 

Listen to your intuition.

Make **daily retrospections to check if you had situations when had a chance to use courage** and ask if you were courageous in those moments.

### Active way

You have a list of acts of courage, and you may procrastinate or not, to put them into action.

The list can contain items that you should say no, but you were afraid of, or things that you should have delegated, but you were afraid to let go of ownership. Make a list and put items on your calendar (not a to-do list).

Running away from problems is always more torturous than the problems themselves.

> People think discipline is about your to-do list. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the thousand other things you could be working on.
