<li>2013-02-14 SET ONE DAY OF THE WEEK THAT AFTER COMING TO HOME YOU WONT BE USING COMPUTER AND FOR ANOTHER DAY YOU WON&#8217;T BE USING THE INTERNET<br />For example:<br />- Wednesday - no computer use after 6&#160;pm<br />- Monday - no internet use after 6&#160;pm<br />It helps me to find time to think and contemplate, clean my room, and get motivation for the rest of the week.</li>
<li>2013-02-14 CONTEMPLATE THINGS AND ACTIVITIES AS THEY COULD BE THE LAST TIME YOU SEE THEM<br />For example:<br />- eat popcorn as it would be your last popcorn in your life<br />- talk to a friend as it would be your last meeting him<br />This technic was used by Stoics, and it is called negative visualization. You have to visualize that it is the last time you do a thing. When listining to a song - imagine that this is the last time in your life you are hearing it. You can read more about this in the book - A Guide to the Good Life</li>
