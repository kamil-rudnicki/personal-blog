You have a list of good habits to implement.

A habit is a change how you react to a situation, from X to Y. When I'm normally in situation A, I behave X. But I want to behave like Y.

So what, if you don't put them into practice!

As a CEO of Timecamp I have a hell lot of good habits I should change to be more productive, be a better leader and manager.

It it crazy, as I know I should and can improve in many areas, but the single most important problem is that I don't remember.

So here is the deal - on how to implement new habits for real I tried.

First step is to have a list of habits, and more importantly situations where those habits should be used.

Then think how often this situation occurs. If it's everyday - great, you can everyday every evening ask yourself - if I put the new habit into action. The more often situation occures it easier.

The ultimate goal is those new habits become second nature, effortless for the man.

Bonus, here is my list of good habits to implement. It's not complete list. It's individual, based on my weaknesses. So your will be different.
