    <ul class="quotes">
        <li>"I’ve had a very lucky career, a very lucky life. I’ve done all that I can do." <div class="author">Steve Jobs</div></li>
        <li>"In your life you only get to do so many things and right now we’ve chosen to do this, so let’s make it great." <div class="author">Steve Jobs</div></li>
        <li>"Our ancestors, in most cases, could not afford to slow down. We can. Much of the rush of our lives exists because we have adopted so many interests and responsibilities, often more than we can manage comfortably. If we give up those activities and responsibilities we have adopted because we believed someone else's claim that they made life better, more interesting, more worthwhile, we could devote ourselves to actually making our lives more rewarding." <div class="author">Bill Allin</div></li>
